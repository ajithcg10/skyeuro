                <h3>Study in the US</h3>
                <p>
                  The United States, known for its groundbreaking innovation and research, is a popular choice among international students, coming in third place behind those interested in studying in Canada and the United Kingdom. Every year, more than 1.1 million applicants (Institute of International Education [IIE]) travel to the United States to study for an advanced degree at one of the worlds most prestigious institutions.   </p>
                <ul class="country-details-list">
                  
                  <li>
                    <h3>
                      Why study in the USA?</h3>
                      <p>Choosing a nation to study while living thousands of miles away from home is a dream for some and a long-term investment. Against this backdrop, the United States has long been a preferred destination for people from all over the world seeking higher education. According to U.S. News & World Report, the United States has 48 top universities out of the top 100 in the world.<br>
                        ● <strong>Top Institutions</strong><br>
                        When it comes to some of the best universities for higher education, the United States of America has the lion's share. 15 American institutions are among the top 20 universities in the world, according to Times Higher Education. According to QS World Rankings, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and Caltech are the top four institutions in the world.<br>
                        ● The United States offers a variety of degrees that are ‘STEM eligible,' allowing international students to stay in the country for an additional two years after completing their degrees to gain practical experience beyond the standard one-year allowance while also working for a US-based organization.<br>
                        ● <strong>Flexible Education System</strong><br>
                        The credit transfer system in the United States of America provides for more flexibility in the educational system. Students at the undergraduate level are encouraged to investigate several fields and pick a major by the end of their second year. Offering a variety of traditional and non-traditional majors and minors and the freedom to choose which, when, and how many classes to take each semester create a highly strengthening structure that lets each individual grow and change according to their strengths and limitations.<br>
                        ● <strong>A Wide Range of Courses</strong><br>
                        Over 2 million programs are available through 4- and 2-year schools, including Bachelors and Masters degrees and Doctoral, Vocational, Associate, and Certificate programs.<br>
                        ● <strong>Research and Development</strong><br>
                        The United States is at the top in research and development. According to the National Science Foundation, universities spent about 22 billion dollars on research and innovation in 2015.<br>
                        ● <strong>Prospects for Employment</strong><br>
                        After completing their degrees, 62 percent of overseas students find work in the United States. The typical pay range after a four-year degree in the United States is approximately 61,000 to 120,700 USD at the mid-career level.</p>
